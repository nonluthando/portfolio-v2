      <p>
        I approach software as both a technical and a human problem. I care about building systems that are reliable,
        understandable, and genuinely useful to the people who rely on them. My work is shaped by an awareness that users
        come from different backgrounds, levels of confidence, and access constraints, and that good software should reduce
        friction rather than create it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am especially interested in building maintainable backend systems with clear structure and predictable behaviour.
        I value clean interfaces, thoughtful error handling, and code that can be tested, understood, and evolved over time.
        For me, good system design is not only about correctness, but about supporting confidence and clarity for both users
        and future developers.

        Designing for clarity, inclusion, and real-world constraints.

      <p>
        Accessibility matters to me because it determines who gets to benefit from technology. Through my academic background
        and project work, I have become conscious of how design decisions affect learnability, confidence, and long term
        engagement. This is particularly important for users who may be new to technology or operating under real world
        constraints.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am drawn to clarity first design, meaningful feedback, and systems that guide users rather than overwhelm them.
        This perspective influences how I think about backend logic and validation, user flows, documentation, and information
        structure.

      <h2>Volunteer and leadership experience</h2>

      <p class="section-subtitle">
        Roles that strengthened my ability to work with people and contribute within teams.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div class="card">

      <p>
        Alongside my technical work, I have been involved in roles that strengthened my ability to work with people,
        communicate clearly, and contribute within teams.
      </p>

      <p>
        I volunteered with the University of Cape Town Science Students’ Council as part of the Events Committee, where I
        helped plan and support student facing events. This role required coordination across committees, working under
        deadlines, and responding to practical challenges as they arose. It strengthened my organisational skills and my
        ability to collaborate in structured environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also served on the Events Committee at MyDomain Residence, where I contributed to planning and coordinating events
        for residents. This experience reinforced the importance of listening to people’s needs, improving participation,
        and ensuring smooth execution. It helped develop a customer focused mindset and confidence in people facing
        responsibilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, I have tutored first year students during their transition into university. This experience shaped my
        understanding of the digital divide, not only as a technology issue, but as a learning and opportunity issue.
        Supporting students through unfamiliar systems reinforced my belief that thoughtful design, clear structure, and
        supportive feedback can meaningfully reduce barriers and build confidence.

    <div class="card">

      <p>
        I am motivated by opportunities where I can continue learning, contribute meaningfully, and build software that is
        both technically sound and considerate of the people who use it. I am particularly interested in roles that value
        strong fundamentals, clear thinking, and a people centred approach to problem solving.
