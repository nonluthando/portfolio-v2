  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    This page expands on how my experiences shape how I think about software,
    people, and impact.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>How I Approach Software</h3>
  <p>
    I approach software as both a technical and a human problem. I care about
    building systems that are reliable, understandable, and genuinely useful
    to the people who rely on them. My work is shaped by an awareness that users
    come from different backgrounds, levels of confidence, and access
    constraints, and that good software should reduce friction rather than
    create it.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am especially interested in building maintainable backend systems with
    clear structure and predictable behaviour. I value clean interfaces,
    thoughtful error handling, and code that can be tested, understood, and
    evolved over time. For me, good system design is not only about correctness,
    but about supporting confidence and clarity for both users and future
    developers.
  </p>

  <h3>Accessibility and People Centred Thinking</h3>
  <p>
    Accessibility matters to me because it determines who gets to benefit from
    technology. Through my academic background and project work, I have become
    conscious of how design decisions affect learnability, confidence, and long
    term engagement. This is particularly important for users who may be new to
    technology or operating under real world constraints.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am drawn to clarity first design, meaningful feedback, and systems that
    guide users rather than overwhelm them. This perspective influences how I
    think about everything from backend logic and validation to user flows,
    documentation, and information structure.
  </p>

  <h3>Volunteer and Leadership Experience</h3>
  <p>
    Alongside my technical work, I have been involved in roles that strengthened
    my ability to work with people, communicate clearly, and contribute within
    teams.
  </p>
  <p>
    I volunteered with the University of Cape Town Science Students’ Council as
    part of the Events Committee, where I helped plan and support student facing
    events. This role required coordination across committees, working under
    deadlines, and responding to practical challenges as they arose. It
    strengthened my organisational skills and my ability to collaborate in
    structured environments.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also served on the Events Committee at MyDomain Residence, where I
    contributed to planning and coordinating events for residents. This
    experience reinforced the importance of listening to people’s needs,
    improving participation, and ensuring smooth execution. It helped develop a
    customer focused mindset and confidence in people facing responsibilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, I have tutored first year students during their transition into
    university. This experience shaped my understanding of the digital divide,
    not only as a technology issue, but as a learning and opportunity issue.
    Supporting students through unfamiliar systems reinforced my belief that
    thoughtful design, clear structure, and supportive feedback can meaningfully
    reduce barriers and build confidence.
  </p>

  <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
  <p>
    I am motivated by opportunities where I can continue learning, contribute
    meaningfully, and build software that is both technically sound and
    considerate of the people who use it. I am particularly interested in roles
    that value strong fundamentals, clear thinking, and a people centred
    approach to problem solving.
