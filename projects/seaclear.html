      <p class="muted">
        SeaClear is a group-built HCI system designed to support beachgoers by improving the clarity and usability of water quality
        information. The project combines public-facing communication with interactive features that help users report issues and
        engage with the platform.

      <h4>HCI approach</h4>
      <p class="muted">
        Because SeaClear is an HCI-focused project, I helped keep the user experience consistent by ensuring the team’s design decisions
        followed usability principles and heuristic guidelines. This included prioritising clear navigation, meaningful feedback,
        readable information structure, and predictable user flows across pages.

      <h4>Community reporting feature</h4>
      <p class="muted">
        I built the user-facing community report flow, including the reporting page and form, adding a beach selection dropdown and
        connecting the submission to backend handling so reports could be saved correctly.

      <h4>Homepage revamp</h4>
      <p class="muted">
        I improved the home page layout and information structure, including beach card layout changes, map placement adjustments,
        and carousel improvements to support a smoother entry experience for users.

      <h4>News section improvements</h4>
      <p class="muted">
        I restructured the news tab for better readability and navigation, and linked the homepage “More News” to a dedicated page

        I contributed to the project report, authored test cases to validate key flows, and wrote a user manual to support usability
        and reduce onboarding friction. This improved evaluation quality and strengthened maintainability.

      <h4>What I learned</h4>
      <p class="muted">
        SeaClear strengthened my HCI approach to development. I learned how to translate usability thinking into concrete changes across
        navigation, information structure, and interface flows. It also reinforced how important documentation and structured testing are
        when building systems meant for public use.
