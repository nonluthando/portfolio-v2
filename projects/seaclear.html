    <div class="card">

      <h4>Overview</h4>

      <p class="muted">
        SeaClear is a group-built HCI system designed to support beachgoers by improving the clarity and usability of water quality
        information. The project focuses on communicating environmental health content in a user-friendly way and providing tools
        for engagement through reporting and education.

      <h2>My contributions</h2>

      <p class="section-subtitle">
        My work focused on page design, information structure, and improving user flows through heuristic-guided iteration.

  <!-- HCI APPROACH -->
  <section>

    <div class="card">

      <h4>HCI approach</h4>

      <p class="muted">
        Because SeaClear is an HCI-focused project, I helped keep the experience consistent by ensuring design decisions followed usability
        principles and heuristic guidelines. I prioritised clear navigation, meaningful feedback, readable information structure, and
        predictable user flows across pages.

      <div class="project-card">

        <h4>Homepage revamp + map integration</h4>

        <p class="muted">
          I improved the home page layout and information structure, including beach card layout improvements, better placement of the map widget,
          and homepage carousel enhancements to support a smoother entry experience for users.
        </p>

      </div>



      <div class="project-card">

        <h4>News page + carousel</h4>

        <p class="muted">
          I designed and implemented the News page structure and contributed to the homepage News carousel. I also sourced relevant news content
          to support credibility and create a clearer narrative around water safety and environmental context.
        </p>

      </div>



      <div class="project-card">

        <h4>Education page content and structure</h4>

        <p class="muted">
          I helped design and structure the Education page into clearer sections and sourced content that explained water quality impact in a
          practical way, including waterborne illnesses, public health risks, and economic impact. I also supported multimedia through video links.
        </p>

      </div>



      <div class="project-card">

        <h4>About page</h4>

        <p class="muted">
          I contributed to the design and structure of the About page to improve credibility and help users understand the motivation and goals of
          the platform.

      <div class="project-card">

        <h4>Community reporting feature</h4>

        <p class="muted">
          I built the user-facing community report flow, including the reporting form and beach selection dropdown, and connected submissions to
          backend handling so reports could be saved correctly.

      <div class="project-card">

        <h4>Base UI and navigation improvements</h4>

        <p class="muted">
          I improved general navigation and UI consistency across the site, including navbar updates, clearer navigation controls, and improved
          flash messages to reduce user confusion during key actions.

    <div class="card">

      <h4>Documentation and QA</h4>

      <p class="muted">
        I authored test cases to validate key user flows and contributed to project documentation, including parts of the report and a user manual.
        This improved evaluation quality and strengthened maintainability.

  <!-- LEARNING -->
  <section>

    <div class="card">

      <h4>What I learned</h4>

      <p class="muted">
        SeaClear strengthened my HCI approach to software. I learned how to translate usability thinking into concrete changes across navigation,
        information structure, and interface flows. I also learned the value of content design and credibility in systems that communicate public
        health information.
