      <p class="muted">
        SeaClear is a group-built HCI system designed to support beachgoers by improving the clarity and usability of water quality
        information. The project focuses on communicating environmental health content in a user-friendly way and providing tools
        for engagement through reporting and education.

      <h4>HCI approach</h4>
      <p class="muted">
        Because SeaClear is an HCI-focused project, I helped keep the experience consistent by ensuring design decisions followed usability
        principles and heuristic guidelines. I prioritised clear navigation, meaningful feedback, readable information structure, and
        predictable user flows across pages.

        SeaClear strengthened my HCI approach to software. I learned how to translate usability thinking into concrete changes across navigation,
