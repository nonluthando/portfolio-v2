      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p class="muted">
        NetworkComm is a Python-based TCP client server chat application built to demonstrate core networking,
        concurrency, and protocol-design concepts. It supports multiple clients connecting to a central server
        and exchanging messages in real time using socket programming and multithreading.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        The project prioritises correctness, clarity, and real-world networking behaviour over UI complexity.

      <h4>Server work</h4>
      <p class="muted">
        The server was originally developed collaboratively as part of a coursework project. I independently enhanced it
        with structured message logging, improved error handling for client disconnects, clearer message formatting, and
        more robust coordination between clients.

    <div class="project-card">
      <h4>Client work</h4>
      <p class="muted">
        I implemented the client independently, including user interaction, server communication, retry logic when the
        server is unavailable, and asynchronous message reception using concurrent threads.

        How the system coordinates multiple clients in real time.

    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <p class="muted">
        The server listens on a specified host and port, while clients connect and register with a nickname. For each
        connected client, the server spawns a dedicated handler thread. Messages are routed through the server based on
        message type, including broadcast, private messages, or room-based messaging.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        On the client side, sending and receiving are handled concurrently using separate threads to support an interactive
        experience without blocking on socket reads.

        This project strengthened my understanding of TCP/IP communication, concurrency using threads, and client server coordination.
        It also improved how I think about protocol design, synchronization, and real-world failure conditions such as disconnects,
        message framing, and ordering.
