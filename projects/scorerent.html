    <h1>ScoreRent</h1>
    <p class="tag">Live · Backend</p>
    <p>
      A rental decision-support web app that helps renters evaluate whether a listing is worth applying for
      before paying non-refundable application fees.

    <h2>What ScoreRent does</h2>
    <p>
      Renters often pay application fees without enough information about whether the listing is realistic for their
      financial situation or documentation. ScoreRent provides an explainable evaluation workflow that generates a
      <strong>confidence score (0–100)</strong> and a verdict:
      <strong>Worth applying</strong>, <strong>Borderline</strong>, or <strong>Not worth it</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The score is based on affordability, document-fit, and demand weighting. It is intentionally designed as a
      <strong>confidence score</strong> (not acceptance probability).
    </p>

    <h2>Key product flows (what’s actually built)</h2>

    <div class="project-card">
      <h3>Guest evaluation flow</h3>
      <p>
        Users can evaluate a listing without signing up by entering renter details and listing requirements.
        The system returns a score, verdict, and clear reasons plus recommended actions.
      </p>
      <div class="pills">

    </div>

    <div class="project-card">
      <h3>Logged-in user flow</h3>
      <p>
        Users can create an account and log in to save a renter profile and keep an evaluation history.
        This turns ScoreRent into an ongoing tool rather than a one-off calculator.

    <div class="project-card">
      <h3>Dashboard + saved evaluations</h3>
      <p>
        Logged-in users get a dashboard view of their most recent evaluation and can review saved listings they have
        evaluated previously. Evaluations are persisted and grouped per user.

    <div class="project-card">
      <h3>Explainable scoring breakdown</h3>
      <p>
        ScoreRent shows <strong>how the score was calculated</strong> by displaying rule-by-rule adjustments
        (before → after), including affordability deductions, missing documents, demand pressure, and verdict assignment.

    <h2>My role / what I built</h2>
    <p>
      ScoreRent is an independently built project that I designed and implemented end-to-end.
      I built the backend logic, the scoring engine, persistence, authentication flow, and deployment.
    </p>

    <div class="project-card">
      <h3>Scoring engine</h3>
      <p>
        I designed a deterministic scoring engine that outputs a confidence score (0–100) and provides explainable
        reasons and actions. This allows users to understand what lowered the score and what can be improved.
      </p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="project-card">
      <h3>Core rules implemented</h3>
      <p>
        The evaluator includes affordability thresholds, document-fit matching, and demand weighting. It supports
        realistic renter scenarios (including student logic).
      </p>
      <div class="pills">
        <span>25/30/35% affordability bands</span>

      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="project-card">
      <h3>Engineering quality signals</h3>
      <p>
        I wrote unit tests for the evaluator logic using pytest and configured GitHub Actions CI to run tests on
        push/PR. The app is deployed live on Render.

        I implemented automated tests for the core evaluate flow using pytest, focusing on correctness of the
        scoring logic and input handling. I also set up CI with GitHub Actions to run tests on every push, helping
        keep the API stable as I iterate and add new features.

    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <div class="project-card">
      <p>
        Building ScoreRent as a deployed, iterative project taught me how to design backend systems for change,
        not just for completion. I learned how to improve API boundaries, validation, and error handling while
        keeping the project maintainable and reliable through automated tests and CI.
