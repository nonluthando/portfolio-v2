  <!-- INSPIRATION (no pills needed) -->
  <section>

    <div class="card">

      <h4>Inspiration</h4>

      <p class="muted">
        I built ScoreRent after seeing people around me transitioning from university residence to real rentals. Many of them were paying
        expensive application fees repeatedly, only to get rejected due to affordability, missing documents, or high demand.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        I wanted a tool that could reduce that risk by making the decision clearer upfront, and by showing renters exactly what is weakening
        their application and what they can do to improve it.
      </p>

    </div>

  </section>



  <!-- WHAT IT DOES -->
  <section>

    <div class="card">

      <h4>What it does</h4>

      <p class="muted">
        ScoreRent evaluates listing requirements against a renter profile and outputs a <strong>0 to 100 confidence score</strong> and a verdict.
        The score is deterministic and explainable. It is intentionally designed as a confidence score, not acceptance probability.
      </p>

  <!-- SCORING ENGINE -->
  <section>

    <div class="card">

      <h4>Explainable scoring</h4>

      <p class="muted">
        The scoring engine starts at 100 and applies rule-based adjustments. Results include reasons, recommended actions, and a full
        breakdown showing score changes (before to after deltas per rule).

  <!-- ENGINEERING QUALITY -->
  <section>

    <div class="card">

      <h4>Engineering quality</h4>

      <p class="muted">
        I wrote pytest unit tests for the evaluator logic to protect scoring behaviour. I also set up GitHub Actions CI to run tests on
        push and pull request. The app is deployed on Render with PostgreSQL persistence.

  <!-- WHAT I LEARNED (no pills needed) -->
  <section>

    <div class="card">

      <h4>What I learned</h4>

      <p class="muted">
        Building ScoreRent taught me how to design system boundaries and keep behaviour predictable while iterating. It also strengthened how I
        think about trust and clarity in decision-support systems, where users need to understand the output, not just receive it.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        From an engineering perspective, I improved my testing discipline and learned how to maintain a live deployed project while continuing
        to build features safely.
